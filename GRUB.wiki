# GRUB

### notice:

## Preparing separate boot partition:  
if needed format to FAT32:  

    mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/sdaX
  
set part type to EFI System:
> to check what it is now run **fdisk -l /dev/sda**  
> if it is *EFI System* you can skip this step
    
    fdisk /dev/sda
    t
    X
    1
  
## mount root and boot partition:

    mount /dev/sdaY /mnt
    mount -o bind /dev /mnt/dev
    mount -o bind /sys /mnt/sys
    mount -o bind /run /mnt/run
    mount -o bind /proc /mnt/proc
    mount /dev/sdaX /mnt/boot/efi
> *mount /dev/sdaX /mnt/boot/efi*  
> this part may vary, check fstab of system you're reparing (*/mnt/etc/fstab*)  
> there should be entry like this:  
>
>     UUID=0FA7-F85D      	/boot/efi 	vfat      	rw,relatime,fmask=0022,dmask=0022,codepage=437,iocharset=ascii,shortname=mixed,utf8,errors=remount-ro	0 2
>
> notice mount path after partition UUID 
 
## chroot  

    chroot /mnt
  
### note:  
there's a package in AUR **arch-install-scripts** which contains **arch-chroot** util  
it's also present in Arch install ISO  
**Use arch-chroot instead, if you can**

## GRUB  
install grub:  

    grub-install /dev/sda
  
make config:

    grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

> it takes /etc/default/grub  
> you may want to set 
>
>     GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBE=false
>
> if you want to auto detect other OSs

## Check fstab  
If you did the formating section, you **need** to do this  
If you're not sure, just check UUID in fstab and *lsblk -f*

> if you have arch-install-scripts you can use **genfstab**  
>
>     genfstab -U > /etc/fstab

get UUID of your boot partition:

    lsblk -f
    
check if it matches UUID from fstab:

    cat /etc/fstab
    
if not - just replace it with one from *lsblk -f*  
#### DO THIS FOR EVERY SYSTEM YOU HAVE ON MACHINE  
#### mount their roots, go to */etc/fstab* and change UUID of boot partition!

## Summary
grub is a pain in the ass to set up properly.
